Preliminaries
=============

These instructions assume that you have cloned the VPE into a folder named vpe, and checked out the "realtime" branch. This can be accomplished as follows (note that on Windows you may need to install/run the Git Bash to invoke these commands, or do the equivalent with a graphical git front-end):

$ git clone https://github.com/qusp/orange3 vpe
$ git checkout realtime

These instructions also assume that you want to install Python into a virtual environment (virtualenv) to prevent version conflicts with packages needed by other Python software on your computer; if this is no concern for you (e.g., you have no other Python software), you can skip the virtualenv-related steps.


On Linux
========

* note for legacy Ubuntu systems: if the Python 3.4 package is not available on your system, you can first add an external repository to your package manager:
  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes

* make sure that your package list is up to date
  (written for Ubuntu):
  $ sudo apt-get update
  
* install the following packages through your package manager (the following list uses the package names for use with apt-get install, tested on Ubuntu 14.10; these may differ for other distributions):
  - build-essential
  - libblas-dev
  - liblapack-dev
  - libgmp-dev
  - gfortran
  - python3
  - python3-dev
  - python3-pip
  - virtualenvpython3-pyqt4
  
* go to the directory where you placed the vpe:
  $ cd /path/to/vpe

* create a virtual environment:
  $ pip3 install virtualenv
  $ virtualenv venv --python=python3 --system-site-packages

* activate virtual environment:
  $ source venv/bin/activate

* install requirements
  $ pip install numpy
  $ pip install -r vpe/requirements.txt

* clone the CPE repo & install its dependencies into vpe venv:
  $ cd ..
  $ git clone https://github.com/qusp/cpe
  $ git checkout your-branch (could be testing, develop, master, or a tag/release)
  $ pip install -r cpe/requirements.txt

* auto-generate widgets for CPE nodes:
  $ python vpe/scripts/regenerate_widgets.py --neuropype-path cpe/neuropype
  (you can re-invoke this command whenever you have edited your CPE code)

* initialize VPE package
  $ cd vpe
  $ python setup.py develop

* you can now launch the VPE using the command:
  > python -m Orange.canvas --clear-widget-settings

* for a good development experience, we recommend
  that you install and set up PyCharm:
  * open the vpe folder from PyCharm
  * under Settings / Project: vpe / Project Interpreter / Project Interpreter make sure that it picked up the folder path\to\cpe\venv; if it didn't (e.g., older PyCharm version), do the following:
      - under Settings / Project: vpe / Project Interpreter / Project Interpreter click the gear icon
      - click Add local..., and select the python executable in your cpe/venv/Lib folder.
      - accept and close the settings dialog. PyCharm will scan your virtualenv once, which will take a few minutes (see bottom progress bar)
  * in the project pane on the left you can now navigate to the file
    Orange / canvas / __main__.py, and then right-click and select
    "Run '__main__'" to run the VPE (or Debug '__main__' to run it in debug mode)

* to launch from the command line, make sure that you have your venv activated like you did during the installation

* you can also use the launch.sh script in the vpe folder  
  
On Windows
==========

Note that, when you switch between git-related commands and Python-related commands (e.g., pip) on Windows, you will likely have to switch between the git bash and a regular command line (cmd.exe).

* Make sure that you have Python 3.4 installed (preferably the 64-bit version). We assume here that you have it in C:\Python34; otherwise adjust the path in the below instructions.

* create a virtual environment:
  > C:\Python34\Scripts\pip3 install virtualenv
  > cd path\to\vpe
  > C:\Python34\Scripts\virtualenv venv

* activate virtual environment:
  > venv\Scripts\activate

* install binary dependencies
  * if you are on a 64-bit Python:
    > pip install https://github.com/qusp/dependencies/blob/master/python/numpy/numpy-1.9.2+mkl-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl?raw=true
    > pip install https://github.com/qusp/dependencies/blob/master/python/scipy/scipy-0.15.1-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl?raw=true
    > pip install https://github.com/qusp/dependencies/blob/master/python/pyqt/PyQt4-4.11.3-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl?raw=true
  * if you are on a 32-bit Python:
    > pip install https://github.com/qusp/dependencies/blob/master/python/numpy/numpy-1.9.2+mkl-cp34-none-win32.whl?raw=true
    > pip install https://github.com/qusp/dependencies/blob/master/python/scipy/scipy-0.15.1-cp34-none-win32.whl?raw=true
    > pip install https://github.com/qusp/dependencies/blob/master/python/pyqt/PyQt4-4.11.3-cp34-none-win32.whl?raw=true

* install requirements
  > pip install -r requirements.txt

* go one step up
  > cd ..

* clone CPE & install its dependencies into vpe/venv (unless you already have the cpe and you're installing the vpe into the cpe's venv):
  > git clone https://github.com/qusp/cpe
  > git checkout your-branch (could be testing, develop, master, or a tag/release)
  > pip install -r cpe/requirements.txt

* auto-generate widgets for CPE nodes:
  > python vpe\scripts\regenerate_widgets.py --neuropype-path cpe\neuropype
  (you can re-invoke this command whenever you have edited your CPE code)

* initialize vpe package
  > cd vpe
  > python setup.py develop

* you can now launch the VPE using the command:
  > python -m Orange.canvas --clear-widget-settings

* for a good development experience, we recommend
  that you install and set up PyCharm:
  * open the vpe folder from PyCharm
  * under Settings / Project: vpe / Project Interpreter / Project Interpreter make sure that it picked up the folder path\to\cpe\venv; if it didn't (e.g., older PyCharm version), do the following:
      - under Settings / Project: vpe / Project Interpreter / Project Interpreter click the gear icon
      - click Add local..., and select the python executable in your cpe/venv/Lib folder.
      - accept and close the settings dialog. PyCharm will scan your virtualenv once, which will take a few minutes (see bottom progress bar)
  * in the project pane on the left you can now navigate to the file
    Orange / canvas / __main__.py, and then right-click and select
    "Run '__main__'" to run the VPE (or Debug '__main__' to run it in debug mode)

* to launch from the command line, make sure that you have your venv activated like you did during the installation
  
* you can also use the launch.bat file in the vpe folder


On Mac OS
=========

* First, install homebrew to be able to install the dependencies:
  $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

* Now install the science packages and other necessary tools:
  $ brew tap homebrew/science
  
* To ensure that you get the right version of Python (currently 3.4.x), install pyenv:
  $ curl -L <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer> | bash

* also get the virtualenv plugin for pyenv so we can create a virtual environment:  
  $ git clone <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv.git> ~/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv

* install Python 3.4.x:
  $ pyenv install 3.4.x
  
* go to the directory where you placed the vpe:
  $ cd /path/to/vpe

* create a virtual environment:
  $ pyenv virtualenv 3.4.x venv
  
* activate virtual environment:
  $ pyenv activate venv

* download the sip and PyQt4 source code (sip is the glue code generator for PyQt4). Unpack and install each package, from within your virtual environment, using these commands:
  $ python3 configure.py
  $ make –j4
  $ make install
  
* install requirements
  $ pip3 install numpy
  $ pip3 install -r vpe/requirements.txt

* clone the CPE repo & install its dependencies into vpe venv:
  $ cd ..
  $ git clone https://github.com/qusp/cpe
  $ git checkout your-branch (could be testing, develop, master, or a tag/release)
  $ pip3 install -r cpe/requirements.txt

* In case the pyzmq package fails to install correctly, try manually installing the following packages and then retry installing pyzmq.
  $ brew install zeromq
  $ python3 -m pip install pyzmq
    
* auto-generate widgets for CPE nodes:
  $ python3 vpe/scripts/regenerate_widgets.py --neuropype-path cpe/neuropype
  (you can re-invoke this command whenever you have edited your CPE code)

* initialize VPE package
  $ cd vpe
  $ python3 setup.py develop

* you can now launch the VPE using the command:
  > python3 -m Orange.canvas --clear-widget-settings

* for a good development experience, we recommend
  that you install and set up PyCharm:
  * open the vpe folder from PyCharm
  * under Settings / Project: vpe / Project Interpreter / Project Interpreter make sure that it picked up the folder path\to\cpe\venv; if it didn't (e.g., older PyCharm version), do the following:
      - under Settings / Project: vpe / Project Interpreter / Project Interpreter click the gear icon
      - click Add local..., and select the python executable in your cpe/venv/Lib folder.
      - accept and close the settings dialog. PyCharm will scan your virtualenv once, which will take a few minutes (see bottom progress bar)
  * in the project pane on the left you can now navigate to the file
    Orange / canvas / __main__.py, and then right-click and select
    "Run '__main__'" to run the VPE (or Debug '__main__' to run it in debug mode)

* to launch from the command line, make sure that you have your venv activated like you did during the installation

* you can also use the launch.sh script in the vpe folder
