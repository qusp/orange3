This GUI is based on Orange 3, whose original README is reproduced below:

Orange is a component-based data mining software. It includes a range of data
visualization, exploration, preprocessing and modeling techniques. It can be
used through a nice and intuitive user interface or, for more advanced users,
as a module for the Python programming language.

This is an early development version of Orange 3. The current stable version
2.7 is available on http://orange.biolab.si (binaries) and
https://github.com/biolab/orange (sources).
